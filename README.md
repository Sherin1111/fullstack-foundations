# Course-Based learning 

This repository contains course-based assignments for learning JavaScript, SQL, and APIs.

## JavaScript
### Overview

This assignment focused on building a creative web app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The main goal was to demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript constructs, DOM manipulation, and event handling while applying best coding practices.

### Key learning outcomes:

- Handling user input and dynamically updating the web page
- Using arrays, loops, boolean logic, and functions
- Applying object methods and DOM events
- Understanding array methods (unshift(), shift(), split())
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

### Project:

A fun interactive web app where users select their preferred perfume notes (top, middle, base) and get a recommendation from a list of perfumes. The page updates dynamically based on user input, and visual cues like background color changes are applied.

### Code improvements / feedback applied:

- Added console.log() for debugging user input and results
- Moved the perfumes array outside of the function for better scope management
- Used consistent formatting, comments, and meaningful variable names
- Added event listeners for user interactions
- Added emojis to represent perfume notes for better UX

### UI / CSS highlights:

- Styled container with rounded borders, shadows, and color accents
- Simple responsive layout for input forms and recommendations
- Background color changes to enhance user interaction
